# Playing along at home

If you'd like to have a go at home, follow these steps.

* Setup git, register with and [setup access github](http://help.github.com/mac-set-up-git/)
* Fork the repository in github. Click the 'Fork' button.
* Setup your local repository. 

    `git clone git@github.com:user/Refactoring-Chapter-1.git`

* Create a new branch from the 1.0 tag. Use your name for the branch.
    
    `git checkout -b bill_and_ben 1.0`

* Go crazy. That's to say, code away, commit often then when you're doneâ€¦
* Request the master pull your changes with a [pull request](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/).
